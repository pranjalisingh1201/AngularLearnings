Angular Course 
-------------------

- Angular is a framework for building modern single-page applications.

- Official Documentations - www.angular.io


How is a single page Application different from traditional Application:

Traditional Applications : 

- Each user Action results in a full HTML page load.
- If we do any action in the browser then a request goes to the server and it returns the full page everytime and refresh of the page happens.

Single Page Application:

- A web Application that is composed of a single page.
- Based on user actions, the application page is update.
- Normally performs a partial update instead of a full page load.

Examples of Single- Page Applications:

- Google Maps
- Gmail-Emails

Angular Solution 

- Angular is a framework for building modern single-page applications.

Who,s Using Angular?

- Australian Government Immigration
- Citi Bank Customer Service
- Microsoft Xbox

Angular History

- Angular 2 and higher follow the same framework approach (incremental improvements)
- March 2017 - Angular 4 
- Novemeber 2017 - Angular 5 
- May 2018 - Angular 6
- October 2018 - Angular 7
- May 2019 - Angular 8   
- November 2017 - Angular 9 
- May 2020 - Angular 10
- October 2020 - Angular 11
- May 2021 - Angular 12
- October 2021 - Angular 13

What is TypeScript?

- Language developed by Microsoft in 2012.
- Free and Open-Source
- Provides static typing support to JavaScipt.
- Helps with IDE Sipport : Code completion and debugging.
- Add support for object-oriented programming.
- Classes, Objects, Inheritance and interfaces etc.
- Official website : www.typesciptlang.org

React Development 

- For React development, we can develop using various languages:

- JavaScipt: extemely popular programming language.
- ECMAScript: standardized version of JavaScipt(ES6,ES9...)
- TypeScript: adds optional types to JavaScipt.
- Other Languages such as Dart etc.

TypeScript is the most popular language for React development.


Why do most React developers use TypeScript?

- Strongly-Types Language with compile time cheching and IDE Support.

- Increased developer productivity and efficiency.


Development Process:

- Create TypeScript code
- Compile the code
- Run the code


Step 1 : Create the TypeScript code

- TypeScript files have .ts extension

Step 2 : Compile the code 

- Web browsers do not understand TypeScript natively.

- Have to convert TypeScript code to JavaScript Code.

- This is known as "transpiling"

- "Transpiling" is accomplished with tsc command 

eg:
>>tsc mydemo.ts

Step 3: Run the code

- To run the JavaScript code, we use the node command.
- Run the generated JavaScript code (.js file)

>> node mydemo.js

- The compiler/ IDE can find errors earlier at compile time.

- JS generates errors only at runtime.
- Hence Compile time errors are way better.



TypeScript Data Types:

1) boolean : true/false
2) number : integer or floating point numbers
3) string : text data. Enclosing in single or double quotes.
4) any : Supports any datatype assignment
5) Others 


Define a Variable 

Syntax : let <variableName>: <type> = <initial value>;

example : let found : boolean = true;

TypeScript "let" keyword

- We are using the new TypeScript let keyword for variable declarations
- As opposed to using traditional JavaScipt var keyword.
- The JavaScript var keyword had a number of gotchas and pitfalls.
- Like Scoping , capturing, Shadowing etc.
- The new Typescript let keyword helps to eliminate those issues.
- TypeScript is strongly Typed.

For long concatinations : use backticks : 
eg:
console.log(`Hi${firstname}{lastname}`);

Growable Arrays
----------------

example :

let sports : string[] = ['Golf', "Cricket"];

sports.push('Baseball');
sports.push('hockey');

for(let sport of sports)
{
console.log(sport);
}

Creating Classes in TypeScript:

- Customer Class

	firstName : string
	lastName : string
	
	constructors
	getter/setter methods.
	
Basic Structure:

class Customer {
	//properties
	//constructors
	//getter/setter methods
}

File name can be any name.

Properties of Class:

class Customer {
//properties
firstName : string ; // Properties are public by default.
lastName : string;
}

Construct an Instance 

class Customer {
	//properties
	firstName : string;
	lastName : string;
}

let myCustomer = new Customer ();

myCustomer.firstName = "Martin";
myCustomer.lastName = "Dixon";

console.log(myCustomer.firstName);
console.log(myCustomer.lastName);

Create a Constructor

class Customer{
	firstName : string;
	lastName : string ; 
	constructor(theFirst:string,thelast:string)// Use constructor keyword
	{
		this.firstName = thefirst;
		this.lastName = thelast;
	}
}


Access Modifiers:

- public - Property is accessible to all classes (default modifier).
- protected - Property is only accessible in current class and subclass.
- private - Property is only accessible in current class.



Note : if we have errors in the code , then to tcs command generates .js file and .js file runs.
- to Prevent this we have a command to stop generating .js files if their is a compilation error.
- tsc --noEmitOnError Customer.ts
- So the flag --noEmitOnError say to not generate a .js file when their is an exsisting compilation error.


Getter/ Setter Methods
-----------------------

class Customer {
	private firstName : string;
	private lastName : string;
	
	public getFirstName() : string
	{
		return this.firstName;
	}
	
	public setFirstName(theFirst: string) : void
	{
		this.firstName = theFirst;
	}
}

let myCustomer = new Customer("Martin","Dixon");

myCustomer.setFirstName("Greg");
console.log(myCustomer.getFirstName());


TypeScript: Accessors - Get/Set

- TypeScript also offers an alternate syntax.
- Define special : get/set methods
- known as Accessors.

Syntax:

- Can give any property name some developers use leading "_".
- Nothing special about "_" No special magic Just a convention.
- Syntax:

	get <space> property ()
	it has no return type.
	set <space> property ()
	it has no return type.
	
Example :

class Customer {
	private _firstName: string;
	private _lastName : string;
	
	public get firstName()
	{
		return this.firstName;
	}
	public set firstName(value:string)
	{
		this.firstName = value;
	}
}

let myCustomer = new Customer("Matin","Dixon");

myCustomer.firstName = "Susan"; //Calls the "set" accessor since we are assigning a value;

// if we dont add public, getter/setter methods will be public by default.

//Variable names and getter / setter method names can be different.

Compiler Flag

- The get/set accessors feature is only supported in ES5 and higher.
- You have to set a compiler flag in order to compile te code.

>> tsc --target ES5 --noEmitOnError Customer.ts

Problem with too many compiler flag:

- You may have noticed , that we have a lot of compiler flags
- TypeScript has a solution : tsconfig.json file.

tsconfig.json
----------------

- tsconfig.json file defines compiler options and project settings.
- Place this file in root of your project directory.

file : tsconfig.json

{
	"compilerOptions":{
		"noEmitOnError":true,
		"target":"es5"
	}
}
